<h1>The Best Movies According to Chandrima</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>This movie is my all time favourite.This movie shows us the value of friendship,leave things for your career but when there is need of love in life chase the the love of your life. </p>
<h3>Never Have I Ever</h3>
<p>It is not a movie , it is a web-series . It can be favourite for any college student.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>It is also a web series.I used to watch this since my childhood and I never get bore out of this.</p>
